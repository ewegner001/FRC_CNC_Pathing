Installation

.. _Installation:

Instead of creating a :term:`CNC` :term:`path` manually, line-by-line (TODO:ADD EXAMPLE), there are :term:`CAM` softwares that have been developed that generate this :term:`gcode` for us.  This is much more reliable, faster and allows us to simulate what the machine will be doing virtually before running the actual program on the machine, and finding out we made a small error somewhere in the typically thousands of lines of code.  This also allows us to easily take operations from similar parts, and apply the same settings (same tool, same path type, ect...) and simply reselect the new geometry--making it much easier to produce parts and quickly make changes.  

This documentation will be using Fusion 360, as it is a free program (with an educational licence), does not require installation of a large program, and has some cloud and collaboration capabilities.
