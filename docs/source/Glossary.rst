  CAD
    Computer Aided Design (CAD) is a method of creating sketches, parts and assemblies virtually.  This is used precisely convey and simulate what a part or assembly will do and gives detail on how such a part should be made.  There are many CAD softwares, including softwares that must be installed such as Autodesk (Inventor/Fusion 360), Solidworks and CREO, as well as softwares that can be run directly in an internet browser such as Onshape.  Nearly all of these CAD softwares have free educational licences and tutorials on their respective websites. 

  CNC
    Computer Numerical Control (CNC) is a method of using a computer to control a machine's movenments precisely based on instructions interpreted from :term:gcode.  Most commonly this refers to CNC machining processes such as CNC mills, but there are many other applications of CNC, such as turning (CNC lathes), bending (CNC brakes), welding and even additive manufacturing (3D printing).

  gcode
    gcode is the language of :term:`CNC` machines and are the instructions that it follows.  gcode can be written by hand, but is most often generated by other computer software.  However--see the reference on :ref:`Useful gcode Commands`, for some common commands that are useful for debugging and understanding what a program or :ref:`path` is trying to accomplish.

  Path
    In :term:`CNC` manufacturing, a path refers to a section of :term:`gcode`, or a subset of a program that a CNC can follow.
